# CUPS-Printing-On-Thermal-Printer
This repository shows you how to print with the C programming language using CUPS library on a thermal printer. I felt like I had to post this as the documentation for CUPS is pretty poor in my opinion, it took countless hours to do something so simple that I ended up doing very easily in the end. If only the documentation was better would have saved a lot of time.

So now I'm helping you, this is how you print "test.txt" file on a thermal printer using 29x90mm thermal paper
